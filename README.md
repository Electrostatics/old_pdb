# Reading and writing old-format PDB files

This code reads and writes the [old PDB format](https://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html).

Development of this code was greatly helped by [the Chimera documentation](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/pdbintro.html).
